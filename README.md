# Resume-Analyzer
This is an AI-driven resume analysis tool built using Streamlit and Google Gemini Pro. It allows users to upload their resume and a job description (in PDF or DOCX format), and receive detailed feedback on how well their resume aligns with the job role. The application reads and extracts text from both files, sends the content to the Gemini Pro model, and returns a structured analysis including alignment score, strengths, weaknesses, and actionable suggestions for improvement.
